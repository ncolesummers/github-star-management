# Feature Refinement Workflow

This workflow guides you through breaking down a feature into user stories and
tasks using agile methodologies, following the GitHub Star Management project's
issue templates.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Analyze Feature Requirements**
   - Review the feature description and objectives
   - Identify the target users and their needs
   - Determine business value and priorities
   - Define feature scope and boundaries
   - Create a feature issue with complete acceptance criteria

2. **Create User Stories**
   - Break down the feature into user stories
   - Follow the format: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
   - Ensure each story delivers independent value
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for each story
   - Add appropriate story point estimates
   - Link stories to the parent feature

3. **Decompose into Tasks**
   - Break each user story into specific technical tasks
   - Keep tasks small (ideally 4-8 hours of work)
   - Define clear, actionable implementation steps
   - Specify technical acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Link tasks to their parent user story

4. **Prioritize and Sequence Work**
   - Organize stories and tasks in priority order
   - Consider dependencies and technical constraints
   - Identify critical path items
   - Group related tasks that should be implemented together
   - Create a suggested implementation sequence

5. **Verify Completeness**
   - Ensure all feature requirements are covered by stories
   - Check that all stories have associated tasks
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are testable
   - Confirm estimates are reasonable
   - Check for proper linking between issues

## Example: Star Categorization Feature Refinement

### Feature Issue

```markdown
# Feature: Automated Star Categorization

## Feature Description

Automatically categorize GitHub stars based on repository metadata including
topics, description, and README content.

## Problem Statement

Users with many starred repositories struggle to find relevant projects when
needed. Manual categorization is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency.

## Proposed Solution

Implement an automated system that analyzes repository metadata and assigns
categories based on configurable rules and machine learning techniques.

## User Benefit

Users can quickly find relevant starred repositories organized by meaningful
categories without manual effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System can categorize repositories based on GitHub topics
- [ ] System can analyze repository descriptions for categorization
- [ ] System can extract relevant information from README files
- [ ] Users can configure category rules and priorities
- [ ] Pre-defined category set is available out-of-the-box
- [ ] Categorization can be run as a batch process on all stars
- [ ] Results can be exported in multiple formats (JSON, MD, CSV)
```

### User Stories

```markdown
## User Story: Topic-Based Categorization

As a GitHub user, I want my starred repositories to be automatically categorized
based on their GitHub topics so that I can find relevant projects quickly.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System fetches topics for each starred repository
- [ ] System maps GitHub topics to pre-defined categories
- [ ] Repositories can belong to multiple categories
- [ ] Categories are assigned confidence scores
- [ ] Results can be reviewed before finalizing

### Story Points: 5
```

### Tasks

```markdown
## Task: Implement Topic Fetching

### Task Description

Create a service to fetch topics for starred repositories using the GitHub API.

### Technical Details

- Use the GitHub API endpoint: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics
- Handle pagination for users with many stars
- Implement rate limiting protection
- Cache results to avoid redundant API calls

### Implementation Steps

1. Add TopicService class in src/core/services/
2. Implement topic fetching with pagination support
3. Add caching mechanism with configurable TTL
4. Add rate limit detection and retry logic
5. Create unit tests with mock responses

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully retrieves topics for all starred repositories
- [ ] Properly handles GitHub API rate limits
- [ ] Includes test coverage for success and error cases
- [ ] Documentation updated with new service details

### Effort Estimate: 4-8 hours
```
