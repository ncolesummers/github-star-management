# Fix Deno KV Type Compatibility Issues

This PR addresses the type compatibility issues identified in issue #11 related
to the Deno KV API. The changes ensure proper type compatibility between the
KvStore interface used in our application and the Deno KV API.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated KvStore Interface in `backup_service.ts`**
   - Replaced direct use of `Pick<Deno.Kv>` with a more flexible interface
     definition
   - Created a custom interface that's compatible with both Deno.Kv and our mock
     implementations
   - Fixed type definitions for methods like `get()`, `set()`, `delete()`, and
     `list()`

2. **Updated MockKv Implementation in `mock_kv.ts`**
   - Revised type definitions to match our custom KvStore interface
   - Updated method signatures to be compatible with Deno.Kv
   - Fixed the return type in `atomic.commit()` method to prevent null
     versionstamp

3. **Fixed Command Registration in `backup_command.ts`**
   - Changed `program.addCommand()` to `program.command()` to match Cliffy's API

4. **Updated Test Configuration**
   - Added `--allow-write` permission to the test task in deno.json

## Test Results

All unit and integration tests are now passing. Type checking is successful with
no remaining compatibility issues.

## Improvements

These changes make the codebase more robust and maintainable by:

1. Creating a better abstraction layer between our application and Deno's KV API
2. Making our mock implementation more faithful to the real API
3. Ensuring proper type safety across the codebase

Fixes #11
