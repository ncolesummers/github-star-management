# Git Hooks Implementation Tasks

The following tasks break down the implementation of the "Automated Code Quality
Checks" user story.

## Task 1: Research and Design Git Hook Strategy

```
---
name: Task
about: Create a specific technical task
title: 'task: Research and design git hook implementation strategy'
labels: task, technical, dx
assignees: ''
---

## Description
Research different approaches to implementing git hooks in a Deno project and design the optimal strategy for our repository.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Research Deno-specific git hook solutions
- [ ] Evaluate different implementation options (shell scripts, Deno scripts, husky-like approach)
- [ ] Analyze cross-platform compatibility challenges
- [ ] Document findings and recommended approach
- [ ] Create implementation plan

## Parent Story
Relates to #XXX (Automated Code Quality Checks)

## Time Estimate
4 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Research document completed with findings
- [ ] Implementation strategy documented with recommendations
- [ ] Approach reviewed and approved
```

## Task 2: Implement Pre-commit Formatting and Linting Hook

```
---
name: Task
about: Create a specific technical task
title: 'task: Implement pre-commit formatting and linting hook'
labels: task, technical, dx
assignees: ''
---

## Description
Create a pre-commit git hook that automatically runs Deno's formatting and linting tools to ensure code quality standards.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Create hook script that runs `deno fmt` and checks for changes
- [ ] Add `deno lint` check to the hook
- [ ] Handle staged/unstaged file scenarios properly
- [ ] Ensure the hook is performant (only check relevant files)
- [ ] Add ability to bypass hook when needed (with warning)
- [ ] Test hook on different file types and scenarios

## Parent Story
Relates to #XXX (Automated Code Quality Checks)

## Time Estimate
6 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pre-commit hook successfully runs formatting and linting
- [ ] Hook only affects staged TypeScript/JavaScript files
- [ ] Performance is reasonable (< 5 seconds for average commits)
- [ ] Works on all supported platforms
```

## Task 3: Implement Commit Message Validation Hook

```
---
name: Task
about: Create a specific technical task
title: 'task: Implement commit message validation hook'
labels: task, technical, dx
assignees: ''
---

## Description
Create a commit-msg git hook that validates commit messages against our conventional commits format requirements.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Create hook script that parses commit messages
- [ ] Implement regex validation for conventional commits format
- [ ] Verify compatibility with our .gitmessage template
- [ ] Add helpful error messages for failed validations
- [ ] Ensure merge commits are handled properly (bypassed)

## Parent Story
Relates to #XXX (Automated Code Quality Checks)

## Time Estimate
4 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Commit-msg hook successfully validates message format
- [ ] Valid conventional commits pass validation
- [ ] Invalid messages are rejected with helpful error messages
- [ ] Merge commits are handled correctly
- [ ] Works with our existing .gitmessage template
```

## Task 4: Implement Pre-push Test Hook

```
---
name: Task
about: Create a specific technical task
title: 'task: Implement pre-push test hook'
labels: task, technical, dx
assignees: ''
---

## Description
Create a pre-push git hook that runs tests to prevent pushing broken code to the repository.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Create hook script that runs `deno task test`
- [ ] Optimize to only run tests affected by the pushed changes if possible
- [ ] Add bypass option for emergency situations
- [ ] Ensure clear error messaging on test failures

## Parent Story
Relates to #XXX (Automated Code Quality Checks)

## Time Estimate
4 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pre-push hook successfully runs tests
- [ ] Failed tests prevent pushing
- [ ] Error messages clearly indicate what tests failed
- [ ] Performance is optimized to only run necessary tests
```

## Task 5: Create Hook Installation Script and Documentation

```
---
name: Task
about: Create a specific technical task
title: 'task: Create hook installation script and documentation'
labels: task, technical, documentation, dx
assignees: ''
---

## Description
Create an installation script for the git hooks and update project documentation with instructions for developers.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Create script to install all hooks
- [ ] Add installation command to project setup instructions
- [ ] Document how each hook works
- [ ] Document how to bypass hooks when necessary
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with git hook information
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## Parent Story
Relates to #XXX (Automated Code Quality Checks)

## Time Estimate
3 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Installation script works across platforms
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md is updated
- [ ] README.md references the hooks if appropriate
- [ ] New developers can successfully set up hooks by following docs
```
