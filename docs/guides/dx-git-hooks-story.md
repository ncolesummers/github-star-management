## User Story

As a developer, I want automated code quality checks via git hooks so that our
codebase maintains consistent standards without manual intervention.

## Story Type

Technical story: Improves developer experience or codebase quality

## Detailed Description

Currently, our project relies on developers remembering to run formatting and
linting commands before committing code. This leads to inconsistent code style
and quality across the codebase. By implementing git hooks, we can automate
these checks to ensure all committed code meets our quality standards.

The project already defines formatting and linting standards in deno.json, but
we lack an automated way to apply them at commit time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pre-commit hook that runs `deno fmt` to ensure consistent code formatting
- [ ] Pre-commit hook that runs `deno lint` to catch linting issues
- [ ] Pre-commit hook that validates commit messages follow our conventional
      commits format
- [ ] Pre-push hook that runs tests to prevent broken code from being pushed
- [ ] Documentation for developers on how the hooks work and how to bypass them
      if needed
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (works on macOS, Windows, and Linux)

## Technical Considerations

- We should use Deno's built-in capabilities for git hooks
- Hooks should be installed automatically when setting up the project
- Consider performance - hooks should run quickly to not disrupt workflow
- Must work with the project's existing commit message template (.gitmessage)

## Dependencies

- Requires deno.json configuration (already in place)
- No external dependencies beyond Deno itself
