# Git Hooks Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating git hooks into the GitHub Star Management project. Git hooks will automate code quality checks, enforce commit message standards, and ensure tests pass before code is pushed.

## Scope Clarification

This implementation plan covers both:
- **Current Scope (User Story #9)**: Core git hooks for code quality
- **Future Enhancement (User Story #10)**: Advanced security and dependency features

Each feature is clearly marked to indicate which scope it belongs to.

## 1. Implementation Approach

After researching available options, we recommend implementing **custom Deno scripts with Git's native hooks** for the following reasons:

- Native integration with our Deno ecosystem
- No external dependencies required
- Full control over hook behavior
- Can be versioned in repository
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## 2. Hook Specifications

### pre-commit
- **Current Scope**:
  - Lint staged TypeScript files with `deno lint`
  - Check formatting with `deno fmt --check`
- **Future Enhancement**:
  - Scan for accidental API tokens/secrets
  - Prevent debug statements (`console.log`, `debugger`)

### commit-msg
- **Current Scope**:
  - Validate against Conventional Commits format
  - Enforce allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
  - Enforce allowed scopes: cli, api, models, services, utils, docs, test, deps, release, workflow, config
  - Check description length and formatting
  - Ensure compatibility with existing .gitmessage template

### pre-push
- **Current Scope**:
  - Run full test suite (`deno task test`)
- **Future Enhancement**:
  - Verify documentation is updated for changed files

### post-checkout and post-merge
- **Future Enhancement**:
  - Check if deno.lock changed and notify developer
  - Run setup tasks when switching branches

## 3. Directory Structure

```
/scripts
  /git-hooks
    /hooks
      pre-commit.ts             # Current Scope
      commit-msg.ts             # Current Scope
      pre-push.ts               # Current Scope
      post-checkout.ts          # Future Enhancement
      post-merge.ts             # Future Enhancement
    /utils
      git.ts
      conventional_commits.ts
      file_checks.ts
    install.ts
    uninstall.ts
    README.md
```

## 4. Installation Process

### Manual Installation

```bash
deno run --allow-run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/git-hooks/install.ts
```

### Automated Installation via deno.json

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "hooks:install": "deno run --allow-run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/git-hooks/install.ts",
    "hooks:uninstall": "deno run --allow-run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/git-hooks/uninstall.ts"
  }
}
```

### Developer Onboarding

Add to CONTRIBUTING.md with instructions for setting up git hooks after cloning the repository.

## 5. Implementation Timeline

| Task | Description | Estimated Time | Scope |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Set up directory structure | Create required directories and initial files | 1 hour | Current |
| Implement install/uninstall scripts | Create scripts to set up git hooks | 2 hours | Current |
| Implement pre-commit hook | Code formatting and linting checks | 3 hours | Current |
| Implement commit-msg hook | Conventional commit validation | 2 hours | Current |
| Implement pre-push hook | Run tests before pushing | 2 hours | Current |
| Update documentation | Update README and CONTRIBUTING.md | 2 hours | Current |
| Testing current hooks | Test core hooks on all supported platforms | 3 hours | Current |
| **Subtotal (Current Scope)** | | **13 hours** | |
| Enhance pre-commit hook | Add security scanning and debug prevention | 2 hours | Future |
| Enhance pre-push hook | Add documentation verification | 1 hour | Future |
| Implement post-checkout/merge hooks | Notify about dependency changes | 2 hours | Future |
| Testing enhanced hooks | Test advanced features on all platforms | 2 hours | Future |
| **Subtotal (Future Enhancement)** | | **7 hours** | |

**Total estimated time: 20 hours**

## 6. Performance Considerations

**Current Scope**:
- Only check staged files in pre-commit hooks
- Implement bypass mechanisms (`git commit --no-verify`) for emergency situations
- Run commands in parallel where possible

**Future Enhancement**:
- Cache results to avoid redundant checks
- Implement selective execution based on changed files
- Add configuration options for tuning performance

## 7. Documentation Plan

**Current Scope**:
1. **scripts/git-hooks/README.md**
   - Core hook descriptions (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push)
   - Basic installation instructions
   - Bypass instructions for emergency situations

2. **Update CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Add hooks installation to setup steps
   - Explain commit message format requirements

3. **Add git hooks section to README.md**
   - Brief overview with link to detailed documentation

**Future Enhancement**:
1. **Expand scripts/git-hooks/README.md**
   - Document advanced features (security scanning, dependency checks)
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Document configuration options

2. **docs/guides/git-hooks.md**
   - Detailed explanation of all hooks including enhancements
   - Common errors and resolutions
   - Best practices for working with hooks
   - Performance optimization guidelines
