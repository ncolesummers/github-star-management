# Research Documentation

This directory contains research materials and documentation generated through
AI assistance.

## Content Generation Process

All content in the research subdirectories was generated through one of two
methods:

1. **Research Tasks via Claude Web UI** - Materials were created by issuing
   specific research tasks to Claude through the web interface at
   [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). These research tasks focused on best
   practices, implementation strategies, and architectural considerations for
   the GitHub Stars Management project.

2. **Claude Code Web Search** - Documents were generated by prompting Claude
   Code to use its web search capabilities to research topics and compile
   findings into structured documentation. This approach was particularly useful
   for gathering information about GitHub API best practices, Claude integration
   patterns, and Deno development standards.

## Purpose

These research materials serve as reference documentation for the project's
development and are not part of the core codebase. They provide valuable
insights into:

- Claude Code custom command patterns
- Integration strategies for AI assistants in development workflows
- Best practices for GitHub API utilization
- Role definitions for specialized AI assistance
- Implementation approaches for the Deno migration

## Usage Guidelines

While these documents provide valuable guidance, they should be treated as
reference materials rather than prescriptive requirements. Development decisions
should be made based on the project's specific needs while considering the
insights provided in these research documents.

## Note on Directory Structure

Some documents may contain references to directory structures that have evolved
during the development process. Always refer to the current project structure
when implementing features or making architectural decisions.
