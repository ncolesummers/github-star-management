2. After each search, reflect on what you've learned and identify gaps
3. Refine your search strategy based on your reflections
4. Synthesize findings progressively as you gather more information
5. Build toward comprehensive conclusions

Between each tool use, explicitly think through:
- What new insights this information provides
- How it relates to previous findings
- What questions remain unanswered
- How to refine your next search
```

**For Complex Analysis Tasks:**

```
Analyze [complex topic] using multiple tools and your interleaved thinking:

<research_phase>
Gather information from various sources, using parallel tool calls where appropriate
</research_phase>

<reflection_phase>
After gathering initial information, use your thinking capabilities to:
- Identify patterns and connections
- Recognize contradictions or gaps
- Formulate hypotheses to test
</reflection_phase>

Based on your reflections, conduct targeted additional research
</deeper_investigation>

<synthesis>
Integrate all findings into a coherent analysis with well-supported conclusions
</synthesis>
```

## V. Advanced Thinking Patterns

```
Using extended thinking, approach this problem through hypothesis testing:

1. Formulate clear hypotheses based on initial information
2. Design mental "experiments" to test each hypothesis
3. Work through the implications of each hypothesis being true
4. Evaluate which hypotheses best explain all available evidence
5. Acknowledge confidence levels and remaining uncertainties

Document your thinking process throughout, showing how evidence supports or refutes each hypothesis.
```

- Find creative solutions that address multiple concerns
- Acknowledge irreconcilable differences
- Recommend balanced approaches
</synthesis>
```

### C. Recursive Problem Decomposition

```
Use your thinking capabilities to recursively break down this complex problem:

1. Identify the highest-level problem statement
2. Decompose into sub-problems
3. For each sub-problem:
   - Assess if it can be solved directly
   - If not, decompose further
   - Identify dependencies between sub-problems
4. Solve leaf-node problems first
5. Build solutions upward through the hierarchy
6. Synthesize into comprehensive solution
