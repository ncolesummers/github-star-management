│   │   ├── github-stars-fetch.md
│   │   ├── implement-pagination.md
│   │   ├── rate-limit-handler.md
│   │   └── error-handling.md
│   ├── cli/                          # CLI-related commands
│   │   ├── add-command.md
│   │   ├── implement-flags.md
│   │   ├── generate-help.md
│   │   └── subcommand-structure.md
│   ├── star-management/              # Star-specific commands
│   │   ├── categorize-stars.md
│   │   ├── cleanup-stars.md
│   │   ├── backup-stars.md
│   │   └── generate-report.md
│   └── documentation/                # Documentation commands

```

### 4. Advanced Workflow Examples

**Star Cleanup Workflow (`workflows/star-cleanup-workflow.md`)**:

````markdown
# GitHub Stars Cleanup Workflow

This workflow guides you through implementing a comprehensive GitHub stars
cleanup process, identifying and categorizing stars that may be candidates for
removal.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Define Cleanup Criteria**
   - Identify criteria for star removal candidates:
     - Archived repositories
     - Repositories with no updates in X years
     - Repositories with specific topics you're no longer interested in
     - Forks that haven't diverged significantly from originals
   - Create configuration options for customizing criteria

2. **Fetch Star Data**
   - Retrieve complete star list with necessary metadata
   - Implement efficient pagination to handle large star collections
   - Cache results to minimize API calls
   - Gather additional metadata for decision making

3. **Analysis Implementation**
   - Create scoring system for removal candidates
   - Implement filters based on configured criteria
   - Add metadata enrichment for better decision making
   - Develop sorting algorithms for prioritizing candidates

4. **User Interface**
   - Design interactive CLI for reviewing candidates
   - Implement batch operations for efficient processing
   - Create clear, informative output formats
   - Add preview mode for seeing potential changes

5. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Implement backup before any removal
   - Add confirmation steps for destructive operations
   - Create undo capability for accidental removals
   - Add logging for all actions taken

6. **Testing**
   - Test with various star collection sizes
   - Verify criteria correctly identify candidates
   - Ensure safety mechanisms work properly
   - Test interactive components with mock inputs

## Implementation Example

```typescript
// Example implementation of star cleanup scoring
function calculateCleanupScore(repo: Repository): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Archived repos are strong candidates
  if (repo.archived) {
    score += 10;
  }

  // Check last update time
  const lastUpdateDate = new Date(repo.updated_at);
  const yearsSinceUpdate = (Date.now() - lastUpdateDate.getTime()) /
    (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
  if (yearsSinceUpdate > 2) {
    score += Math.floor(yearsSinceUpdate) * 2;
  }

  // Check fork status
  if (repo.fork && !repo.hasSignificantChanges) {
    score += 5;
  }

  return score;
}
```

### 5. Enhanced CLAUDE.md Content

Update the CLAUDE.md file to include specific guidance for star management workflows:

```markdown
# Star Management Workflows

## Star Categorization

When categorizing stars, follow these principles:
1. Use repository topics as primary signals
2. Consider repository description and README content
3. Look at programming languages used
4. Consider owner and organization information
5. Check for related repositories in the same category

Preferred categories should include:
- Development Tools
- Libraries & Frameworks
- Documentation & Learning
- Applications
- Data Science & Analytics
- DevOps & Infrastructure
- Security
- Personal Projects

## Star Cleanup Criteria

When identifying stars for potential removal, consider:
1. Last update time (2+ years with no updates is a candidate)
2. Archived repositories (usually safe to remove)
3. Forks that haven't diverged from originals
4. Repositories that no longer align with your interests
5. Repositories with better alternatives now available

Always back up stars before cleanup operations.

## Report Generation

Star reports should include:
1. Total star count and distribution by category
2. Growth trends over time
3. Language distribution
4. Activity metrics (recently updated vs. stale)
5. Top organizations and developers in your stars
6. Topic clustering and analysis
````

### 6. Command Parameter Standardization

Implement consistent parameter patterns for commands:

- **Category-Based**:
  `/project:star:categorize --algorithm=topic-based --min-confidence=0.7`
- **Timeframe-Based**: `/project:star:cleanup --older-than=2y --archived=true`
- **Output-Based**:
  `/project:star:report --format=markdown --output=star-report.md`
- **API-Related**:
  `/project:api:rate-limit --endpoints=stars,repos --strategy=adaptive`

### 7. Integration with GitHub Actions

Create commands specifically designed for GitHub Actions workflows:

**GitHub Action Integration (`commands/devops/github-action-setup.md`)**:

```markdown
# Set Up GitHub Action for $ARGUMENTS

You're implementing a GitHub Action workflow for automated star management. The
$ARGUMENTS parameter specifies the specific action to implement (backup,
cleanup, report, etc.).

Follow these steps:

1. **Define Action Requirements**
   - Understand the specific needs for $ARGUMENTS
   - Identify required permissions and secrets
   - Plan for scheduling and trigger events
   - Consider output and notification requirements

2. **Design Workflow File**
   - Create appropriate workflow structure
   - Define job steps and dependencies
   - Set up proper authentication
   - Configure environment and setup steps

3. **Implementation**
   - Create the workflow YAML file
   - Implement action steps using the Deno CLI
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Configure outputs and artifacts

4. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments in the workflow file
   - Create usage documentation
   - Document required secrets and permissions
   - Add examples for common configurations

5. **Testing**
   - Implement local testing with act if possible
   - Plan for controlled production testing
   - Add validation steps to prevent accidental data loss
   - Implement logging for troubleshooting

Remember to follow GitHub Actions best practices for security and reliability.
