## Introduction to Claude Code Custom Commands

Claude Code offers a powerful system for creating custom commands that can be
used to automate repetitive tasks, standardize workflows, and improve team
collaboration. These commands are stored as Markdown files in specific
directories and can be invoked through slash commands in the Claude Code
interface.

There are two primary types of custom commands:

- **Project-specific commands**: Available only within a specific project,
  stored in `.claude/commands/`
- **Global commands**: Available across all projects, stored in
  `~/.claude/commands/`

Custom commands enhance workflow efficiency by:

- Standardizing complex processes
- Reducing context window usage for repetitive tasks
- Allowing parameterization through the `$ARGUMENTS` keyword
- Creating reusable templates for common development patterns
- Facilitating team collaboration through shared command libraries

## Command Structure & Organization

### File Structure

The `.claude` directory serves as the central configuration hub for Claude Code
in a project:

```
.claude/
├── claude.json          # Main configuration file
├── commands/            # Project-specific commands
│   ├── command1.md
│   ├── command2.md
│   └── specialized/     # Optional subdirectory organization
├── roles/               # Role definitions
│   ├── role1.md
│   └── role2.md
├── settings.local.json  # Local settings (not checked into git)
└── workflows/           # Complex workflow definitions
    ├── workflow1.md
    └── workflow2.md
```

### Command Format

Commands are written in Markdown files with clear, instructional content. The
`$ARGUMENTS` keyword can be used to pass parameters from the command invocation.

Example command file (`.claude/commands/fix-issue.md`):

```markdown
Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps:

1. Understand the issue described in the ticket
2. Locate the relevant code in our codebase
3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Prepare a concise PR description
```

This command would be invoked as `/project:fix-issue 123` to address issue #123.

### Role-Based Commands

Role-based commands allow Claude to adopt specific expertise profiles when
performing tasks. These roles are defined in the `.claude/roles/` directory and
can be referenced in commands.

Example role file (`.claude/roles/deno-api-specialist.md`):

```markdown
# Deno API Specialist

## Role Definition

You are a Senior API Developer with 10+ years of experience developing RESTful
APIs, with specialized expertise in Deno TypeScript and GitHub's API ecosystem.
You've built dozens of API clients for major platforms and have extensive
knowledge of rate limiting, pagination, error handling, and response processing.

## Expertise

- Expert knowledge of GitHub's REST API v3
- Deep understanding of Deno's fetch API and network capabilities
- Extensive experience implementing token bucket rate limiting
- Mastery of TypeScript type systems for API response modeling

## Responsibilities

- Design and implement the GitHub API client for the Stars Management project
- Create TypeScript interfaces for GitHub API responses
- Implement robust rate limiting and pagination
- Develop error handling strategies for API interactions
```

### Workflow Definitions

Complex workflows can be defined in the `.claude/workflows/` directory to guide
Claude through multi-step processes.

Example workflow file (`.claude/workflows/implement-api-feature.md`):

```markdown
# Implement GitHub API Feature

This workflow guides you through implementing a new GitHub API feature in the
Deno TypeScript project.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Analyze API Requirements**
   - Review GitHub API documentation for the endpoints needed
   - Identify required request/response types
   - Consider rate limiting implications
   - Determine pagination requirements

2. **Update Type Definitions**
   - Add or extend interfaces in `src/core/models/` for API entities
   - Create request/response type definitions
   - Ensure proper optional/required properties

3. **Implement API Client Methods**
   - Add methods to `GitHubClient` in `src/core/api/github.ts`
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add pagination support if needed
   - Add rate limiting considerations
```

## Advanced Command Techniques

### Parameterized Commands

Commands can be made more flexible by using the `$ARGUMENTS` keyword to accept
parameters:

```markdown
# Generate a TypeScript interface for $ARGUMENTS

1. Analyze the JSON structure provided
2. Create a TypeScript interface with appropriate types
3. Add JSDoc comments for each property
4. Implement proper optional types where applicable
5. Follow project naming conventions
```

### Extended Thinking Integration

Commands can leverage Claude's extended thinking capabilities for complex
problems:

```markdown
# Analyze Architecture Decision for $ARGUMENTS

Think deeply about the architectural implications of $ARGUMENTS. Consider:

1. Performance impacts
2. Scalability considerations
3. Maintenance complexity
4. Alternative approaches
5. Testing strategies
```

The specific trigger words map to increasing thinking budget:

- "think" → 4,000 tokens
- "think hard" → 10,000 tokens
- "think harder" → 20,000 tokens
- "ultrathink" → 31,999 tokens

### Command Chaining

Complex operations can be broken down into multiple commands that work together:

1. `.claude/commands/analyze-stars.md` - Analyzes starred repositories and
   generates categories
2. `.claude/commands/generate-report.md` - Creates a report based on the
   analysis
3. `.claude/commands/cleanup-recommendations.md` - Suggests repositories to
   unstar

## Integration with Project Workflows

### CLAUDE.md Integration

The `CLAUDE.md` file serves as a central reference point for Claude. It should
include:

- Project overview and structure
- Development environment setup
- Command usage guidelines
- Testing protocols
- Code style guidelines
- Important project-specific context

Commands can reference information in the `CLAUDE.md` file to maintain
consistency.

### GitHub Workflow Integration

Commands can be designed to work with GitHub workflows:

```markdown
# Review Pull Request $ARGUMENTS

1. Fetch the PR details using the GitHub CLI
2. Analyze the changes for potential issues
3. Check for adherence to project coding standards
4. Verify test coverage
5. Provide detailed feedback in a comment
```

### Test-Driven Development

Commands can enforce test-driven development practices:

```markdown
# Implement Feature with TDD: $ARGUMENTS

1. Understand the feature requirements
2. Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
3. Implement the minimum code needed to pass the tests
4. Refactor while keeping tests passing
5. Document the implementation
```

## Best Practices from Early Adopters

### Organizational Structure

Early adopters recommend:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize commands in subdirectories by
   function (API, CLI, Testing, Documentation)
2. **Role-Based Approach**: Create specialized roles for different aspects of
   development
3. **Workflow Automation**: Define complex workflows as separate files
4. **Parameter Standardization**: Use consistent parameter patterns across
   commands

### Command Design Principles

Effective commands typically follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each command should focus on one specific task
2. **Clear Instructions**: Include step-by-step guidance with explicit criteria
3. **Context Provision**: Include necessary context within the command
4. **Error Handling**: Anticipate potential issues and provide recovery steps
5. **Documentation**: Include usage examples and expected outcomes

### Versioning and Maintenance

For command maintenance:

1. **Version Control**: Include commands in git repositories for team sharing
2. **Documentation**: Maintain a catalog of available commands with descriptions
3. **Regular Updates**: Review and update commands as project requirements
   evolve
4. **Deprecation Strategy**: Clearly mark deprecated commands and provide
   alternatives

## Recommendations for Optimization

Based on our research and analysis of the GitHub Stars Management project, we
recommend the following optimizations:

### 1. Restructure Command Organization

Create a more granular command structure organized by domain:

```

│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── implement-rate-limiting.md
│   │   ├── add-pagination.md
│   │   └── create-client-method.md
│   ├── cli/
│   │   ├── add-command.md
│   │   ├── implement-flags.md
│   │   └── update-help-text.md
│   ├── testing/
│   │   ├── create-unit-test.md
│   │   ├── mock-github-api.md
│   │   └── integration-test.md
│   └── documentation/
│       ├── update-readme.md
│       ├── generate-api-docs.md
│       └── create-examples.md
├── roles/

# Analyze Repository Structure: $ARGUMENTS

Think deeply about the repository organization for $ARGUMENTS.

1. Assess current structure
2. Identify potential categorization schemes
3. Consider user accessibility and discoverability
4. Think harder about edge cases and special repositories
5. Propose an optimal organization strategy
```

### 5. Create Parameterized Command Templates

Develop a set of standardized command templates with parameters:

```markdown
# Generate API Client for $ARGUMENTS

1. Analyze the $ARGUMENTS API documentation
2. Design TypeScript interfaces for request/response
3. Implement rate limiting based on API constraints
4. Add pagination support for list endpoints
5. Create comprehensive error handling
6. Document usage examples
```

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md with Comprehensive Context

Enhance the CLAUDE.md file to include:

- Detailed project architecture
- Deno TypeScript best practices
- GitHub API integration guidelines
- Rate limiting and caching strategies
- Test-driven development workflow
- Command usage examples

### 7. Implement Consistent Command Invocation Patterns

Standardize command naming and invocation:

- `/project:domain:action` - e.g., `/project:api:implement-rate-limiting`
- `/project:role:task` - e.g., `/project:deno-specialist:optimize-fetch`
