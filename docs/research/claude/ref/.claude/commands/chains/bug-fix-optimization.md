# Bug Fix & Optimization Chain Workflow

I need you to help analyze and fix a bug or performance issue through multiple
expert perspectives sequentially.

**Bug/Issue**: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: TypeScript Quality Engineer Perspective

First, as a TypeScript Quality Engineer:

- Analyze the root cause of the issue
- Identify code quality problems or anti-patterns
- Assess type safety and error handling
- Review related code for similar issues
- Recommend immediate fixes and preventive measures

## Phase 2: Senior Frontend Architect Perspective

Next, as a Senior Frontend Architect:

- Evaluate architectural implications of the fix
- Consider impact on existing component structure
- Assess performance implications
- Recommend architectural improvements
- Plan for scalability and maintainability

## Phase 3: Senior SDET Perspective

Then, as a Senior SDET:

- Design tests to prevent regression
- Create comprehensive test cases for the fix
- Plan integration and E2E test coverage
- Establish monitoring and alerting for similar issues
- Recommend quality gates to catch future occurrences

## Phase 4: Cybersecurity Engineer Perspective

Finally, as a Cybersecurity Engineer:

- Assess security implications of the bug and fix
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities
- Recommend security hardening measures
- Plan security testing and validation
- Consider compliance and audit requirements

**Instructions**: After each phase, document key findings and recommendations.
Provide a final comprehensive fix plan with implementation steps, testing
strategy, and prevention measures.
