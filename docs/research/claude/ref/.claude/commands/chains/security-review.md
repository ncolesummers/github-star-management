# Security Review Chain Workflow

I need you to conduct a comprehensive security review through multiple expert
perspectives sequentially.

**Code/System to Review**: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Cybersecurity Engineer Perspective

First, as a Cybersecurity Engineer:

- Conduct OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Analyze authentication and authorization patterns
- Review data protection and privacy compliance
- Assess input validation and injection prevention
- Identify security monitoring and logging gaps

## Phase 2: DevOps Engineer Perspective

Next, as a DevOps Engineer:

- Review deployment security and CI/CD pipeline
- Assess infrastructure security configurations
- Evaluate secrets management and environment security
- Review monitoring and incident response capabilities
- Consider compliance and audit trail requirements

## Phase 3: Senior Frontend Architect Perspective

Then, as a Senior Frontend Architect:

- Analyze client-side security patterns
- Review state management for sensitive data
- Assess API integration security
- Evaluate third-party dependency security
- Consider browser security and CSP implementation

## Phase 4: TypeScript Quality Engineer Perspective

Finally, as a TypeScript Quality Engineer:

- Review type safety for security-critical code
- Analyze error handling and information disclosure
- Assess input validation and sanitization
- Review code quality for security implications
- Recommend secure coding patterns

**Instructions**: After each phase, document security findings and risk
assessments. Provide a final comprehensive security report with prioritized
recommendations, remediation steps, and security improvement roadmap.
