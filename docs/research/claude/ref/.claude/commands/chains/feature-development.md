# Feature Development Chain Workflow

I need you to help develop a new feature by working through multiple specialized
perspectives sequentially.

**Feature/Task**: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Product Manager Perspective

First, adopt the role of a Product Manager and:

- Define clear user stories and acceptance criteria
- Identify success metrics and KPIs
- Outline MVP vs full feature scope
- Consider business value and prioritization
- Assess market positioning and competitive advantage

## Phase 2: Senior Frontend Architect Perspective

Next, as a Senior Frontend Architect:

- Design the technical architecture
- Define component structure and reusability patterns
- Plan state management approach
- Identify integration points with existing systems
- Consider performance and scalability implications

## Phase 3: TypeScript Quality Engineer Perspective

Then, as a TypeScript Quality Engineer:

- Define type interfaces and contracts
- Plan error handling strategies
- Ensure type safety across components
- Recommend coding standards and patterns
- Design validation and data flow patterns

## Phase 4: Senior SDET Perspective

Finally, as a Senior SDET:

- Create comprehensive test strategy
- Define test cases for each component
- Plan E2E testing approach
- Establish quality gates and CI/CD integration
- Design accessibility and cross-browser testing

**Instructions**: After each phase, explicitly document key decisions and
constraints that should inform the next phase. Provide a final synthesis with
actionable next steps and implementation roadmap.
