# Quick Performance Optimization

As a Senior Frontend Architect, analyze and optimize performance for: $ARGUMENTS

## Performance Analysis Focus:
- **Rendering Performance**: Component re-renders and optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting and lazy loading opportunities
- **Memory Usage**: Memory leaks and efficient data structures
- **Network Performance**: API calls and data fetching optimization
- **Runtime Performance**: Algorithm efficiency and bottlenecks

## Optimization Strategy:
1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Profile and measure current performance
2. **Prioritize Fixes**: Focus on highest impact optimizations
3. **Implement Solutions**: Provide specific code improvements
4. **Measure Impact**: Define metrics to validate improvements

## Quick Wins Checklist:
- [ ] React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] useMemo/useCallback for expensive calculations
- [ ] Code splitting for large components
- [ ] Image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] API call batching and caching
- [ ] Bundle analysis and tree shaking

Provide immediate, implementable performance improvements with measurable impact.
