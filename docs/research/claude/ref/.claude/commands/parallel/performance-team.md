# Multi-Perspective Performance Analysis Team

Analyze the following performance issue or optimization opportunity from three
simultaneous expert perspectives:

**Performance Issue/Optimization**: $ARGUMENTS

## Parallel Analysis Required:

### Perspective 1: Senior Frontend Architect

- Architecture-level performance bottlenecks
- Component rendering and re-rendering optimization
- State management performance implications
- Bundle size and code splitting opportunities
- Caching strategies and data fetching patterns

### Perspective 2: TypeScript Quality Engineer

- Code-level performance anti-patterns
- Type system performance implications
- Algorithm and data structure optimization
- Build-time performance improvements
- Development tooling and workflow optimization

### Perspective 3: DevOps Engineer

- Infrastructure and deployment performance
- CDN and asset delivery optimization
- Server-side rendering and caching strategies
- Monitoring and observability implementation
- Scaling and load balancing considerations

## Synthesis Instructions:

After analyzing from all three perspectives:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Primary performance bottlenecks identified
2. **Impact Assessment**: Performance gains potential for each optimization
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Effort vs. benefit analysis for each
   recommendation
4. **Optimization Roadmap**: Prioritized list of performance improvements
5. **Monitoring Strategy**: Metrics and alerts to track performance improvements

Format the output as a comprehensive performance optimization plan with
technical analysis from each perspective, prioritized recommendations, and
implementation timeline.
