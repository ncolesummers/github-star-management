# Multi-Perspective Code Review Team

Analyze the following code changes from three simultaneous expert perspectives:

**Code/PR to Review**: $ARGUMENTS

## Parallel Analysis Required:

### Perspective 1: Senior Frontend Architect
- Architecture patterns and design decisions
- Component structure and modularity
- Performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Scalability concerns and maintainability
- Integration patterns and data flow

### Perspective 2: TypeScript Quality Engineer
- Type safety and contract definitions
- Code quality and standards adherence
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Best practices and anti-pattern identification
- Build and tooling implications

### Perspective 3: Cybersecurity Engineer
- Security vulnerabilities and risk assessment
- Authentication/authorization pattern security
- Data protection and privacy compliance
- OWASP compliance and security best practices
- Input validation and injection prevention

## Synthesis Instructions:
After analyzing from all three perspectives:
1. **Alignment Areas**: Identify where all perspectives agree
2. **Conflicting Recommendations**: Highlight disagreements and propose resolutions
3. **Prioritized Feedback**: Provide unified, prioritized recommendations
4. **Specific Improvements**: Suggest concrete code changes with examples
5. **Risk Assessment**: Overall risk level and mitigation strategies

Format the output as a comprehensive code review with sections for each perspective, followed by synthesized recommendations and action items.
